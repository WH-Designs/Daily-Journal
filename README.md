## Overview
This application is my first application using angular, I started learning typescript and angular Wednesday 21st and finished this project on Tuesday 27th and I made this application because I felt I needed a better tool to use to track my
day to day life and all of the events and things that happen during it so that I can practice and be more self aware and be able to learn and grow more as a person.

### Vision Statement
It is a daily journal application where a user can go to log their day to day and reflect on their day and 
how some things may have affected them or changed them in any way shape or form. The user will be able to fill
out a form which has a simple user interface in which has a form in which the user can log their daily events and
a log in which they can see past days and be able to reflect on them.

## Design Principles

1. Appreciate that people make mistakes
2. Value people and make systems that work for them
3. Keep it simple
4. Modularize, break things down, use good organization, make it understandable
5. Automate as much as possible
6. Create a system that prevents people from making mistakes
7. But not in such a way to prevent them from getting things done
